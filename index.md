## Biography

I am an Associate Professor at [URJC](https://gestion2.urjc.es/pdi/ver/luis.aranda) and member of the [CAPO](https://caporesearch.es/) research group.  
My research focuses on high-speed, low-power digital design using FPGAs for robotics and space applications.

I teach courses in robotics, analog/digital electronics, and FPGA-based systems.  
Currently working on fault-tolerant neural networks for planetary rovers and space image processing.
