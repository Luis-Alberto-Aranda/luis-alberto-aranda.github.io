I am an Associate Professor at [URJC](https://gestion2.urjc.es/pdi/ver/luis.aranda) and member of the [CAPO](https://caporesearch.es/) research group. My current research focuses on high-speed low-power digital design in [FPGAs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array) for robotics and space applications.

I received my B.Sc. in Industrial Engineering and my M.Sc. in Robotics from [UC3M](https://www.uc3m.es/Inicio) in 2012 and 2015, respectively. I obtained my Ph.D. (with Honors) in Industrial Engineering from [Universidad Nebrija](https://www.nebrija.com/) in 2018.

From 2013 to 2014, I worked as a Project Engineer at Zeus Creative Technologies S.L., where I developed hardware and software solutions for 3D scanning and printing systems based on computer vision. I later joined Universidad Nebrija as a professor and researcher in the ARIES Research Center from 2015 to 2021.

During that time, I actively contributed to research projects in collaboration with the Spanish National Institute for Aerospace Technology ([INTA](https://www.inta.es/INTA/es/index.html)) and the European Space Agency ([ESA](https://www.esa.int/About_Us/ESTEC)). These projects involved the development of fault-tolerance techniques for multi-core systems and RISC-V-based processors for space applications, in partnership with [Frontgrade Gaisler](https://www.gaisler.com/) and [QinetiQ Space NV](https://www.qinetiq.com/en/).

At URJC, I teach courses in robotics, analog/digital electronics, and FPGA-based systems.
