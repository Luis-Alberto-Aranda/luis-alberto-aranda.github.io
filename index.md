## About Me

I am an Associate Professor at [URJC](https://gestion2.urjc.es/pdi/ver/luis.aranda) and member of the [CAPO](https://caporesearch.es/) research group.  
My research focuses on high-speed low-power digital design in FPGAs for robotics and space applications.

I received my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering in 20XX and have taught courses in robotics, analog/digital electronics, and FPGA-based design.  
Currently, I'm working on fault-tolerant neural networks for space environments and FPGA-based control systems for autonomous drones.
